# Prism JS code editor
A very simple code editor built using prismJS.

## How it's done
The basic idea is that there is a textarea that takes the input and then a "pre" container which houses the output. All of this is made to work by funky positioning and a lot of courage. 

Basically, the output is layered over the input to give the illusion that the text is being highlighted as it is typed.

## Limitations:
* Only for javascript.
* Tab sometimes might not work properly.
* Has quite a few bugs. (I mean I made it in half an hour so, yeah.)
